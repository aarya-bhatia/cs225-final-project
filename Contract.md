# CS 225 Data Structures
## Team Contract: Segfault (aaryab2-arora21-atanwar2)

#### Communication
1. **Team Meetings**: Our team will meet twice a week: Tuesdays from 1:30 - 3:30 PM and Fridays from 3 - 4 PM. We will decide whether weâ€™re meeting virtually through Zoom or in-person 2 days in advance, depending on our schedules. All team memebers will take turns, on a weekly basis, for being the note-taker. Notes from every meeting will be written on a google document.  The designated note-taker will also be in-charge of drafting the weekly Development Log, which will be discussed during the Friday Meetings. 
2. **Assistance**: Team members can be contacted through calls, iMessages, and email. We are expected to respond within 24 hrs to ensure accountability. 
3. **Respect**: During the weekly Tuesday meeting, 30 minutes will be allocated for individual feedback. So, every member will have 10 minutes of uninterrupted time to personal indiviual progress, concerns, opinions and ideas. If a unanimous agreement can't be reached, decisions will be made based on majority vote. We, as a team, commit to respectfully listening and engaging with our teammates' ideas. 

#### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution**: We have divided our project into three stages: processing datasets, applying algorithms, and data visualization. Each step has been assigned a leader who will overlook the progress during that stage. We plan to use trello where the current leader can list out tasks that need to be completed and each members can volunteer to work on specific deliverables. Based on the number of deliverables in each stage, each member will be required to take up a minumum number of tasks. Each member is expected to clearly communicate any issues they may be facing (busy weeks, problem with coding etc.) so extra assistance can be planned. Cases of uneven distribution of work will be discussed during the team meeting. 
2. **Time Commitment**: Each memeber is expected to commit 2-3 hours individually and 2-3 hours as a team. Every member is required to work atleast 2 hours and no more than 6 hours weekly. If a task is taking longer than expected, other team member should be asked for help. If all the members are stuck on a problem, we will reach out to our mentor, or use office hours for assisstance. Team members are encouraged to send polite reminders for task completion in order to hold each other accountable. In the case that a team member is consistently not completing any of their assigned tasks, further action like alerting the course staff may be taken. 
3. **Conflict Resolution**: If there's a disagreement between the members regarding project specifics, decisions will be made based on majority vote after each member is given the opportunity to share their opinions. For effective team work, weekly expectations about task completion, team meetings, and work ethic will be set in agreement as a team. If expectations are not met during the week without any communication, members will be politely asked to explain themselves. If mediation cannot solve an issue, course staff will be involved. 

By signing this contract, all team members agree to the expectations and commitments stated above.
